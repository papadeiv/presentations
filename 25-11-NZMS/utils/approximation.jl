Computes the approximate normalisation constant of a pdf by Gauss-Kronrod quadrature.

The input function `f::Function` depends on some `parameters::Vector{Float64}` from which the approximate normalisation constant is computed over a specified `domain::Tuple`.
If no `domain` is given, then `f::Function` is assumed to depend on a cubic potential of coefficients `{c1,c2,c3}` provided in `parameters`.

## Keyword Arguments
* `accuracy=1e-8`: relative accuracy criterion for the quadrature iterations.

## Output
* `normalisation_constant::Float64`: normalisation constant to make `f` a pdf 

## Example

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Fits a polynomial potential of a certain `degree` by solving a linear least-squares problem on its probability density function.

The LLS above is defined by `bins` and `distribution` corresponding to the bins'centerpoints and the heights of an histogram creating an empirical distribution. 
It uses the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Plank equation of diffusion level `noise` so that an explicit equilibrium (stationary) distribution explicit depends on the potential of the Langevin dynamics. 

If instead of `bins` and `distribution` one only provides a `timeseries`, then the potential, which is assumed to be a cubic, is approximated by solving a nonlinear least-square problem.

## Keyword Arguments
* `N=nothing`: normalisation constant of the equilibrium distribution. If unknown (default) then the function uses the OUP assumption to compute it
* `n_coeff=3::Int`: degree of the polynomial function to be fitted (defaults to `3`)
* `n_bins=nothing`: number of bins to approximate the histogram of the stationary distribution as computed by `fit_distribution` (defaults to the `floor` integer of 2% of the total number of timesteps in `timeseries`)
* `noise=nothing`: additive noise of the scalar SDE generating the `timeseries` (defaults to `std(timeseries)`)
* `initial_guess=nothing`: initial value for the vector of coefficients to be used by the optimiser (if nothing is passed it defaults to the solution of `approximate_solution` which uses the OUP assumption)
* `optimiser=1e-2`: standard deviation of the noise injected in the `initial_guess` (defaults to `1e-2`)
* `attempts=1000::Int`: number of tries on the initial guess for the optimiser in case of failure or numerical instability (defaults to `1000`)
* `verbose=false`: print on screen whether the method converged or not 

## Output
`potential::Tuple`
* `potential.points::Vector{Float64}`:
* `potential.potential::Vector{Float64}`:
* `potential.fit::Vector{Float64}`:
